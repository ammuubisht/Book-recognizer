# book-recognizer
<p> Book Recognizer is an OpenCV Program that helps in recognizing Books by using ORB keypoints detector and descriptors extractor. It detects the keypoint in the Image data we provide it and then matches those to the real-time webcam images, if the number of good matches is above a threshold number then it'll classify the book name of that index. That's it for the working. </p>
Practical, real-world projects.
